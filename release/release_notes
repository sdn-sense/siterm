# SiteRM 1.5.60 Production release

## New features and fixes
- VPP/DPDK In Kubernetes with NIC passthrough. SENSE now builds containers for VPP/FRR/DPDK Router, that is preconfigured for SENSE.
- RTMon and SiteRM full workflow: Automatically issue Iperf3, FDT, ETHR. Ping, traceroute from Host and Network devices;
- Junos devices queries moved to use XML. Improvement to get configuration from ~2m to 30sec.
- VLAN Identitification and conflict resolution. SiteRM checks all ports and vlan ranges to ensure that it is not used in any other port.
- VRF Support in Arista devices
- Node Exporter Passthrough via Frontend. Sites are not required anymore to open node_exporter port to autogole monitoring.
- Ansible runtime output store in files. Hit a limit of Subprocess and AsyncIO (>500kb messages are not guaranteed to work.)
- Container images built and uploaded to Quay.io (default registry). Dockerhub - as a fallback. Only last 2 stable containers are kept
- And many other small fixes: No lldpd is not an error, monitor disk usage, snmp mac table for vpp/dpdk, Network status in the model fix...
