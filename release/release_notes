# SiteRM 1.5.40 Staging Release

## SiteRM fixes and improvements

- **Frontend**
  - Support 3 RDF types for delta and model: turtle, json-ld, n-triples. In the backend, SiteRM moved from turtle to n-triples, which gives 10x improvement for model serialization #218
  - Support iPerf, FDT, Traceroute, Ping from L3 actions #860
  - Agents will not accept delta if the Ruler service is disabled #777
  - Liveness and Readiness status reported in Prometheus and raise warnings #792
  - Policy Service and LookupService will not accept deltas while the first run not finished. This allows SiteRM to ensure that the SiteRM has up to date model based on the real-time network information #793, #795
  - Check that the Delta request does not allow overlapping IP Requests #890
  - Allow control of Traffic classes for network devices via configuration. Defaults are: 1 - bestEffort; 4 - softCapepd, 7 - guaranteedCapped. #440
  - Frontend migrated to EL9 as the default image
  - Install and export Apache stats in Prometheus format

- **Agent**
  - Agent and Debugger processes are split into separate containers. Debugger can be deployed on any Host or Public IP Range to allow L3 actions #860
  - Debugger support for iPerf and FDT actions under L2/L3 Addresses. #860
  - Missing Routing service information in the model for hosts # 870
  - Identify the routing table ID dynamically in case no routing table file is available #877
  - Junos devices issue rollback 0 in case of apply failures #721
  - Allow to use LLDP Daemon socket or enable running the LLDP Daemon inside the container #881
  - SiteRM Agent releases EL8, EL9, EL10 containers. This is required to select the proper release if the LLDP Daemon socket is used. #881

- **Ansible improvements**
  - Junos devices issue rollback 0 in case of apply failures #721
  - Junos identifies switchport and raises a warning if the interface state is incorrect #869
